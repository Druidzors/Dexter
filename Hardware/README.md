Future home of Dexter hardware design files. Currently, you can find these files at:
- Motor board:<br>
Now in the Motor PCB folder above. This is the version for Dexter 1 and Dexter HD robots. The prior version is at:<BR>
https://github.com/kgallspark/Dexter/tree/master/MotorControl <br>
- Opto interruptors:<br>
https://github.com/kgallspark/Dexter/tree/master/OPTO (see updated schematic and BOM in the Opto folder here)<br>
LEDs: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/lite-on-inc/LTE-4206/160-1028-ND/121704 <br>
Phototransistors: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/lite-on-inc/LTR-4206E/160-1030-ND/121710 <br>
Harmonic Drives: www.hanzh.com/ but you need the number 14 component set. This is not listed in their site but they do reply quickly. The problem here is that the lead time is 9-12 weeks. We do not sell them directly. The gear ratio is 52:1.
